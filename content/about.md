Hi! I’m **Javier Pulido**, a Cloud Security Engineer with a passion for making complex infrastructure safe, automated, and compliant. Over the past several years, I’ve helped my company build and secure their AWS environment using infrastructure-as-code, identity federation, and proactive monitoring.

## Core Expertise
- **AWS Governance & Landing Zones**  
  Designing multi-account structures with AWS Control Tower, Service Catalog and Secure Baselines to enforce least‑privilege and separation of duties.

- **Identity & Access Management**  
  Implementing AWS SSO via Google IdP, fine‑grained permission provisioning with Terraform modules, and session tagging strategies across Bitbucket Pipelines.

- **Infrastructure Automation**  
  Writing and modularizing Terraform and CloudFormation templates to provision IAM roles, configure AWS Config rules, and automate Security Hub notifications through Lambda/SNS/SES.

- **Incident Response & Forensics**  
  Establishing IR processes in dedicated AWS accounts, leveraging AVML over SSM for memory acquisition, and securing evidence with strict S3 lifecycle and access policies.

- **DevSecOps Integrations**  
  Building Slack bots and daily Lambdas to ingest Security Hub findings, correlate authorship via AWS Config, and proactively notify responsible parties.

- **ISO 27001:2023 compliance**  
  By leveraging AWS services, custom automated remediation, and tailored alerting based on continuous monitoring, I help ensure my company's infrastructure remains compliant with the latest ISO 27001:2023 standards.

## Writing & Community
With **The Hidden Port**, I want to share knowledge and experiences in:
- **Cloud Security** tutorials and automation recipes  
- **Personal Cybersecurity** guides for home labs and digital hygiene  
- **Compliance Simplified** walkthroughs for ISO 27001 & SOC2 on small teams

## Why This Blog?
Technology moves fast. Misconfigurations slip through the cracks. Here, I document:
1. **Practical how‑tos** that you can apply in minutes  
2. **Lessons learned** from real‑world audits and incident analysis  
3. **Tools & templates** you can plug into your own environments
