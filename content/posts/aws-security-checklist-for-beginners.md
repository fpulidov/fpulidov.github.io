Misconfigurations continue to be the leading cause of cloud breaches. This **2025 checklist** covers the most critical AWS security controls you should implement‚Äîwhether you're running a side project or managing production workloads.

Use it to review your setup, catch vulnerabilities early, and build security in by default.

---

## 1. Secure the Root Account

- **Enable MFA** (preferably a hardware key like YubiKey or FIDO2)
- **Delete root access keys** if any exist
- **Use an IAM user or IAM Identity Center** for daily admin tasks

---

## 2. Block Public S3 Access

- Enable **Block Public Access at the account level**
- Verify bucket-level settings for sensitive workloads
- Monitor via **AWS Config rules** or **Access Analyzer**

AWS now enables these protections by default‚Äîbut older accounts may still be vulnerable.

---

## 3. Apply IAM Best Practices

- Use **IAM Identity Center (SSO)** for human access
- Replace long-term credentials with **STS temporary credentials**
- Enforce MFA using IAM policies

```json
"Condition": {
  "BoolIfExists": { "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true" }
}
```

Use tools like **IAM Access Analyzer** and **Policy Simulator** to refine access.

---

## 4. Enable Logging Everywhere

| Service       | Configuration |
|---------------|----------------|
| **CloudTrail** | Org-wide, multi-region, logs to S3 and CloudWatch |
| **VPC Flow Logs** | All VPCs, at least to S3 |
| **GuardDuty** | All regions + EKS enabled |
| **AWS Config** | Track all resource types across all regions |

> Set log retention (30‚Äì90 days) to avoid unnecessary costs.

---

## 5. Enable Threat Detection

- Enable **GuardDuty** (monitors DNS, CloudTrail, network activity)
- Enable **Security Hub** for a centralized security view
- Use **AWS Config** for continuous assessment and configuration changes logging

Set up SNS alerts for **critical and high** GuardDuty or Security Hub findings.

---

## 6. Harden Network Security

- Audit **Security Groups** (block `0.0.0.0/0` on SSH/RDP)
- Use **SSM Session Manager** instead of bastion hosts
- Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for visibility
- Use **private subnets** for internal resources
- (Advanced) Consider **AWS Network Firewall** for deeper inspection

---

## 7. Monitor Cloud Costs

- Create **AWS Budgets** with thresholds for cost spikes
- Enable **Anomaly Detection** for new service usage or region activity

This helps catch signs of misconfigured resources or potential compromise.

---

## 8. Automate Security and Compliance

- Use **Control Tower** for multi-account environments
- Define **custom AWS Config rules** with Lambda
- Consider using **AWS Config automatic remediation** for certain non-compliant changes
- Send **weekly Security Hub summaries** to email or Slack

Automation helps maintain standards even as your environment grows.

---

## 9. Perform Monthly Checks

- Run **IAM Credential Reports** (or better yet, automate it to detect unused credentials)
- Review **Trusted Advisor** free security checks
- Track **Security Hub Score** and set improvement targets

Use these reports to catch drift and stale resources early.

---

## 10. Stay Current and Keep Improving

- Review this checklist quarterly
- Subscribe to AWS Security blog updates
- Consider running threat detection simulations using **GuardDuty Malware Protection**
- Implement Incident Response playbooks to follow in case of incident

---

## Final Thoughts

Security isn't just about avoiding breaches‚Äîit's about building systems that are *resilient by design*.

Whether you're new to AWS or an experienced engineer, this checklist gives you a clear baseline to protect your environment from common mistakes.

*Start with the basics. Stay consistent. Keep leveling up.* üîê
