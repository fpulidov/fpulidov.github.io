Perfect — let’s start by drafting the **updated EC2 Hardening Guide**.
I’ll keep it detailed, actionable, and structured so it’s easy to follow, while also signaling authority to both readers and Google.

# EC2 Hardening Guide (Updated 2025)

> **Last updated:** September 2025. </br>
> This guide consolidates AWS official best practices, CIS Benchmarks, and real-world experience to help you secure Amazon EC2 instances.

---

## 1. System Updates & Patch Management

* **Enable automatic patching** with **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**:

  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y     # Amazon Linux
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y   # Ubuntu/Debian
  ```
* Use **SSM Patch Manager** to automate OS/security updates across fleets:

  * Create a **Patch Baseline**.
  * Attach to EC2 via **IAM Role with SSM managed policy**.
  * Schedule via **Maintenance Windows**.

---

## 2. Least Privilege IAM Roles

* Never hardcode credentials inside EC2.
* Attach an **Instance Role** with **only the permissions needed**:

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
* Enable **IAM Access Analyzer** to detect overly broad permissions.

---

## 3. Network Security

* Restrict inbound traffic with **Security Groups**:

  * Deny `0.0.0.0/0` on SSH/RDP; instead allow only **trusted IP ranges**.
  * Example rule: `22/tcp → 203.0.113.0/24`.
* Add **Network ACLs** for an extra layer of defense.
* Require **VPN/Bastion host** for administrative access.

---

## 4. OS Hardening

* Disable root login over SSH:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  PermitRootLogin no
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ```
* Enforce **key-based authentication** (it is preferable to only allow SSM auth)
* Configure **firewalld/ufw** inside the OS for host-based filtering.
* Remove unused software packages.

---

## 5. Disk & Data Protection

* Encrypt **EBS volumes** with **AWS KMS CMK**.
* Use **automatic snapshot encryption** for backups.
* Enable **EBS fast snapshot restore** only in secure regions.
* If handling sensitive data → enforce **KMS key rotation (every 365 days)**.

---

## 6. Monitoring & Logging

* Enable **CloudTrail** for all regions → send logs to **S3 + CloudWatch Logs**.
* Use **GuardDuty** for continuous threat detection.
* Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for visibility into network traffic.
* Install **CloudWatch Agent** on EC2:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y
  /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
  ```

---

## 7. Backup & Recovery

* Use **AWS Backup** with lifecycle rules for snapshots.
* Store snapshots in **separate accounts (backup vaults)**.
* Regularly test recovery from snapshots/AMI.

---

## 8. Compliance & Benchmarking

* Use **AWS Security Hub** with **CIS EC2 controls enabled**.
* Run **AWS Config** with rules like:

  * `restricted-ssh`
  * `ec2-instance-managed-by-ssm`
  * `ec2-ebs-encryption-by-default`

I'll be posting soon a full walthrough about **Meeting CIS Benchmarks for EC2**.

With these steps, your EC2 instances are aligned with AWS and CIS best practices, reducing attack surface while staying auditable for compliance.
