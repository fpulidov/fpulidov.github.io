# How I Passed the AWS Certified Security â€“ Specialty (SCS-C02) Exam in 2025

Breaking into cloud security isn't easy â€” and staying sharp is even harder.  
This April, I finally earned my AWS Certified Security â€“ Specialty (SCS-C02) certification, and in this post, I want to share exactly how I prepared, what worked, and a few things I wish I knew earlier.

If you're aiming for this cert, I hope this helps you navigate the journey more smoothly.

## My Background

Last year I finally became a Cloud Security Engineer after years chasing this position, because of that I knew I needed to deep dive into AWS Security, so this certification became my goal.  
Before specializing fully in security, I spent several years in DevOps â€” which gave me a strong foundation in infrastructure, but cloud security demands a very different mindset.

## How I Studied

My study journey was a bit unusual:  
I actually started back in September 2024 by watching [**Zeal Voraâ€™s course on Udemy**](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-security-specialty/) and working through the practice exams included.

However, due to a sudden workload spike at my job, I had to put studying on hold until 2025.  
When I resumed, I found an amazing recommendation thread on Reddit:  
> [Reddit AWS Certifications Study Resources Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/s/6MwRtAtxrP)
> *Special thanks to [u/madrasi2021](https://www.reddit.com/user/madrasi2021/) for his masive threads*

That thread pointed me towards:
- [**Stephane Maarekâ€™s Security Specialty course (Udemy)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-security-specialty/) â€” I watched it at 1.5x speed to refresh my memory. Itâ€™s only 16 hours, but it's extremely well-structured and easy to digest.
- [**Tutorial Dojoâ€™s Practice Exams**](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-security-specialty-practice-exams-scs-c02/ref/thehiddenport) â€” by Jon Bonso, legendary in the AWS cert world.

## Total Study Time

All combined â€” including my earlier September sessions â€” I estimate I spent about **80â€“100 hours** preparing:
- Watching video lectures
- Taking practice exams
- Reading explanations of wrong answers
- Playing around in AWS (hands-on really helped)

## Exam Focus Areas

While the exam touched almost every domain, I noticed a stronger emphasis on:
- **AWS Organizations** and multi-account management
- **Fleet management** (managing large numbers of resources securely)
- **CloudFront security configurations**

Oddly, no questions about **CloudHSM** came up for me.

## Practice Exams

Tutorial Dojoâ€™s practice exams were incredibly helpful.  
They werenâ€™t exact replicas of the real exam questions â€” but the style, difficulty, and experience were **very close** to what I faced on exam day.

âœ… I consistently scored **85%+** in both Udemy quizzes and TD practice exams.  
âœ… My real exam score was **839**, almost perfectly in line with my mocks.

## What Helped Me Most

The biggest game-changer for me was **reading the explanations** for every wrong question â€” not just noting the right answer.

Over time, this helped me deeply understand:
- Subtle differences between similar services (like Macie vs GuardDuty vs Inspector)
- How AWS expects you to prioritize security controls (least privilege, defense in depth, managed services when possible)

## My Advice to Future Candidates

If I could give just a few tips, it would be:
- Finish at least one good video course completely (Stephane or Zeal are great)
- Hammer through practice exams â€” and **focus more on WHY an answer is correct/incorrect** than memorizing
- Track your weak areas and reinforce them aggressively
- If possible, get **hands-on** in an AWS account (even if itâ€™s free tier)

Itâ€™s a technical exam, but it rewards understanding AWS security philosophy, not rote memorization.

## Final Thoughts

The SCS-C02 isnâ€™t easy â€” but itâ€™s fair.  
And more importantly, it teaches you to think like a **Cloud Security Engineer**, not just a certification chaser.

If youâ€™re preparing, stick with it.  
Youâ€™ll come out not just with a certification, but with real skills you can immediately apply.

Good luck â€” and see you at The Hidden Port for more cloud security deep dives!

## ðŸ“© Stay Tuned

I'm planning more AWS security, incident response, and hands-on content soon.
