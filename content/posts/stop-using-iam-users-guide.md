IAM users once helped us bootstrap AWS environments, but in 2025 they are outdated and dangerous. This guide breaks down the risks, modern alternatives, and how to migrate securely‚Äîstep by step.

---

## Why IAM Users Are a Problem in 2025

| Risk | Impact | Frequency |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Long-term credentials | #1 cause of cloud breaches | 63% of compromises |
| Manual MFA enforcement | Inconsistent protection | 42% of accounts |
| No centralized lifecycle | Orphaned users linger | 3.7x more vulnerable |
| Cross-account sprawl | Hard to audit/maintain | 81% of enterprises |
| Limited visibility | Manual key rotation required | 57% non-compliant |

## Modern Alternatives to IAM Users

### 1. IAM Identity Center (Successor to AWS SSO)

**Best for:** Human access to AWS across accounts  
**Benefits:**
- Integrates with IdPs like Google, Azure AD, Okta
- Manages permissions via centralized permission sets
- Enables SCIM provisioning and audit visibility

---

### 2. STS + AssumeRole for Automation

**Best for:** EC2, Lambda, and inter-service communication  
**Advantages:**
- Credentials expire automatically
- Supports external ID and MFA
- No static secrets to manage

```bash
aws sts assume-role   --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AutomationAccess   --role-session-name "devops-session"
```

---

### 3. OIDC Federation for CI/CD Pipelines

**Best for:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Bitbucket  
**Advantages:**
- No access keys stored in code
- Tight role scoping per repo/workflow
- Credentials rotate automatically

**GitHub Actions Example:**
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions
          aws-region: us-east-1
```

## Migration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Discover Existing IAM Users and Usage

Before making changes, you need a clear picture of who‚Äôs using what.

#### Step 1: Generate a Credential Report
This report lists all IAM users in your account, their MFA status, and if they have active access keys.

```bash
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report --query Content --output text | base64 -d > credential-report.csv
```

Review this CSV file to identify:
- Users without MFA
- Users with long-standing credentials
- Unused accounts

#### Step 2: Map Use Cases
Group IAM users into categories:
- Human access ‚Üí plan migration to Identity Center
- CI/CD and automation ‚Üí migrate to STS or OIDC
- Legacy systems ‚Üí evaluate and isolate

---

### Phase 2: Replacement

- Replace human IAM users with **IAM Identity Center**
- Replace automated access with **STS AssumeRole**
- Reconfigure CI/CD pipelines to use **OIDC federation**

---

### Phase 3: Cleanup

Make sure that, for all migrated users, there are no remaining credentials

---

## If You Must Keep IAM Users...

If you have legacy apps that require IAM users:

- **Enforce MFA**
- **Rotate access keys automatically**
- **Monitor with CloudTrail and GuardDuty**

---

## Final Thoughts

IAM users served their time‚Äîbut in 2025, they are no longer secure or scalable.

By transitioning to **Identity Center for users**, **STS for automation**, and **OIDC for pipelines**, you're moving toward a modern, zero-trust access model that scales with your org.

*Let IAM users rest in peace. Your future is federated.* üîê
