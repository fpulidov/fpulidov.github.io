title: "I Built an AWS Incident Response Toolkit (and You Can Use It)"
date: 2025-05-20
summary: "After publishing my free AWS IR checklist, I decided to go one step further — a full incident response toolkit with Terraform code, automation scripts, and ready-to-use templates. Here’s what’s inside."

## Why I Built This Toolkit

After sharing my [Incident Response in AWS article](../incident-response-aws-guide/) and a free downloadable checklist, I received a lot of feedback — mostly from engineers saying the same thing:

> *“This is helpful, but I still have to piece everything together.”*

So I built a complete AWS Incident Response Toolkit.

This bundle goes much further than the checklist: ready-to-use Terraform to deploy the notification pipeline, Python scripts for SES and Slack alerts, and a matrix of tools you can use during forensic investigations. It’s designed to save you time, avoid mistakes, and make response feel a lot less chaotic.

> 💡 You don’t have to be a Terraform expert — just update a few variables and deploy with `terraform apply`.

## Use Cases

Whether you're:

* A cloud security engineer handling incidents solo
* A DevSecOps team responding to GuardDuty findings
* A consultant setting up IR workflows for clients

…this toolkit helps you deploy faster, communicate better, and keep a paper trail.

## Where to Get It

🛠️ You can grab the full toolkit here:
👉 [Buy the AWS IR Toolkit on Gumroad](https://1220446601165.gumroad.com/l/aws-ir-tool)

I’ve priced it at **€9** to make it accessible, but still sustainable for me to keep updating it.

You’ll get all future updates for free — including any new scripts, improved playbook versions, or Notion templates I release.

There is also a Gumroad community set up where you can suggest additions to the bundle.

## Final Thoughts

This was built from real-world pain. I just wanted to make something useful that I wish existed when I was building IR workflows.

If you grab the toolkit and find it useful, I’d love to hear from you. Your feedback will help shape version 2.

Until then — stay ready.
