# AWS Incident Response Playbook Template

## Incident Response Playbook Overview
This template provides a structured outline for detecting, investigating, and responding to 
security incidents in AWS. It assumes limited team size and leverages AWS-native services.

---

## Triage Checklist

- [ ] Confirm GuardDuty/Security Hub finding
- [ ] Review AWS Config changes
- [ ] Determine scope of access or compromise
- [ ] Log incident in internal tracking system
- [ ] Check IAM activity via CloudTrail

---

## Isolation Actions

- Isolate instances using security group modifications or move to a quarantine subnet
- Remove affected usersâ€™ permissions temporarily
- Detach public-facing interfaces or load balancers where applicable

---

## Evidence Collection

### EBS Snapshots

- Identify attached volumes with `describe-instances`
- Create snapshots for each volume
- Tag with incident ID and timestamp

### Memory Dump (Linux EC2)

- Trigger AVML dump via SSM command
- Store result in versioned, write-only S3 bucket
- Encrypt at rest with SSE-S3 or KMS

### Retrieve Instance Metadata

- Use SSM to run: `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- Save output to secure S3 bucket
- Include as part of forensic report

---

## Cold Storage for Evidence

- Use S3 Glacier or Deep Archive for long-term storage
- Apply Object Lock (Governance or Compliance mode)
- Tag evidence with:
  - Case ID
  - Analyst name
  - Acquisition date

---

## Post-Incident Analysis

- Conduct internal review with involved stakeholders
- Identify control failures and response delays
- Determine if playbooks or detections require updates

---

## Reporting Template

## Response Log Table

| Action Taken            | By Who       | When (UTC)        | Signature       |

## Final Checks

- [ ] IAM credentials rotated
- [ ] Affected services redeployed / sanitized
- [ ] Findings documented in Security Hub
- [ ] Evidence backed up to S3 Glacier

---

**Note:** Adapt this playbook to your environment. Test it in advance. Incident response is a skill â€” rehearse it regularly.
