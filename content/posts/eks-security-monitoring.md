# EKS Security Monitoring: Visibility, Runtime Detection & Best Practices

Monitoring Kubernetes on AWS (EKS) brings challenges beyond traditional EC2 or IAM setups — pods, containers, control plane, node behavior, runtime threats — all need attention. This guide walks you through what to monitor, which tools matter, and how to build a monitoring strategy for EKS that balances depth, cost, and security.

## 1. What Makes EKS Monitoring Special

- **Dynamic infrastructure**: Pods are ephemeral; nodes may scale up/down; containers restart; workloads shift.  
- **Multi-layered architecture**: You have the cluster control plane, worker nodes, container runtime, networking, storage.  
- **Shared responsibility & visibility gaps**: AWS manages the control plane, but worker nodes, pod configuration, and runtime monitoring are your responsibility.  
- **Volume & noise**: Logs from kubelet, CNI plugins, app pods, etc. Filtering and prioritization are critical.

## 2. Types of Monitoring in EKS

| Monitoring Type | What It Covers | Why It Matters |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Infrastructure / Control Plane** | API server logs, audit events, scheduler, node health | Detect cluster-level issues, privilege abuse |
| **Application / Pod-level** | Container logs, resource usage, restarts, failures | Catch misbehaving containers and app issues |
| **Security / Runtime Events** | RBAC changes, `kubectl exec`, privilege escalation, filesystem/network anomalies | Detect attacks or insider threats |
| **Network & Storage** | Pod-to-pod, ingress/egress, storage latency/errors | Spot misconfigurations, data leakage |
| **Observability & Alerts** | Dashboards, alerts, traces | Help with debugging and SLA adherence |

---

## 3. AWS-Native Monitoring Tools for EKS

- **CloudWatch Container Insights** → Cluster, node, pod-level metrics.  
- **CloudWatch Logs + Fluent Bit** → Collect stdout/stderr from pods, node system logs, kubelet/kube-proxy.  
- **EKS Control Plane Logging** → API server, audit, authenticator, scheduler logs.  
- **CloudWatch Observability Operator** → Simplifies metrics and dashboards.  
- **Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus + Grafana** → PromQL queries and custom visualization without managing infra.  
- **AWS X-Ray & OpenTelemetry** → Distributed tracing for microservices.  
- **AWS Security Hub Integration** → Centralize findings and alerts from multiple sources.  

---

## 4. Runtime Security & Threat Detection

- **Falco + Plugins**  
  - Detects anomalies in container behavior and Kubernetes API events.  
  - The `k8saudit-eks` plugin monitors audit logs for high-risk actions (`kubectl exec`, RBAC changes, etc.).  

- **Audit Logs**  
  - Enable audit logging for EKS.  
  - Monitor high-value events: role bindings, service account creation, privileged pods.  

- **Custom Rules & Baselines**  
  - Define what “normal” looks like for your cluster.  
  - Alert when workloads deviate (e.g., images pulled from unknown registries, privileged pods).

## 5. Building an EKS Monitoring Pipeline: Architecture Example

Here’s a sample end-to-end architecture you could adopt. You can scale or trim depending on cluster size, security posture, cost tolerance.

### Architecture Overview
- Enable control plane logging to CloudWatch.  
- Deploy Fluent Bit DaemonSet for node and pod logs.  
- Use Container Insights or Prometheus for metrics.  
- Deploy Falco with custom runtime rules.  
- Forward Falco alerts via Fluent Bit → CloudWatch Logs.  
- Transform alerts to AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF) → ingest into Security Hub.  
- Route high-severity alerts to Slack, email, or PagerDuty.

### Sample Steps & Considerations

| Step                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable control plane audit & other logs** | Via EKS console or IaC, enable control plane logs: API server, authenticator, etc. Ensure they’re sent to CloudWatch.                                               |
| **Deploy Fluent Bit (DaemonSet)**           | On all worker node groups, configure it to collect pod logs (stdout/stderr), system logs, kubelets, etc. Apply filters to drop low-value logs (e.g. verbose debug). |
| **Deploy Container Insights**               | Use the Container Insights add-on or Observability Operator. Ensure metrics from nodes & pods are collected.                                                        |
| **Deploy Falco via Helm**                   | With custom rule files, mounting audit log streams if applicable. Use Kubernetes service account with right IAM permissions.                                        |
| **Set up Security Hub / Alert Routing**     | Use AWS Lambda or built-in integrations. Determine severity, which alerts to send to DevSecOps / ops. Possibly automate remediation for highest-severity findings.  |
| **Dashboard & Visualization**               | Use Grafana (managed or self-hosted) for internal dashboards. Use CloudWatch dashboards for quick overviews.                                                        |




### Cost / Performance Considerations
- More logging = more cost. Logs from control plane + audit + Application - stdout + Falco = high volume. Drop / sample / filter early.
- Retention: Hot vs cold. Archive older logs.
- Number of rules: Falco / audit rules too permissive → noise. Too many alerts → alert fatigue.
- Resource usage: Falco + Fluent Bit consume CPU / memory; choose node sizes accordingly or isolate in separate node group.

## 6. Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

1. Enable only relevant control plane log types: too many logs create noise and costs.
2. Structured logging: use JSON or other structured formats so that filtering / dashboards work well.
3. Use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) for log agents and detection tools to limit permissions.
4. Filter / Sample / Drop unneeded logs: e.g. drop very verbose events in production.
5. Baseline then alert on anomalies rather than static thresholds only.
6. Keep Falco / detection rules up to date: attack tactics evolve.
7. Monitor the monitor itself: are your agents failing? Are logs being ingested? Are metrics stale?
8. Set up alert routing and priority: not every event needs paging; group, suppress, alert levels.

## 7. Conclusion

EKS adds complexity to AWS monitoring in the form of ephemeral pods, runtime threats, and audit visibility gaps. But by layering AWS-native tools (CloudWatch, GuardDuty, Security Hub) with open-source detection (Falco, Prometheus, Grafana), you can cover infrastructure, runtime, and security monitoring in a practical way.  

EKS security monitoring is not about logging everything, it’s about collecting the right signals, prioritizing them, and making alerts actionable. Done right, you gain visibility, catch misconfigurations early, and detect threats before they escalate.
