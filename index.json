But if you\u0026rsquo;re running lean, or just want better control over where your money is going, you can achieve excellent security visibility with surprisingly low cost.\nThis article breaks down how to do exactly that.\nWe‚Äôll cover:\nWhich AWS services give you security telemetry for free (or close to it) How to set up event-driven alerts with minimal runtime costs Open-source options that plug into AWS without turning into money pits Architecture patterns for teams of all sizes By the end, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a solid strategy that keeps your AWS environments monitored ‚Äî without needing to sell an organ.\nWhy AWS Monitoring Costs Spiral Understanding the primary cost drivers helps you design smarter from the start:\nCloudWatch Logs: billed by ingestion volume and retention duration. CloudTrail: multi-region trails with long-term S3 storage + optional CloudTrail Lake. AWS Config: charges per rule evaluation. Athena queries: priced per TB scanned ‚Äî expensive if used without partitions. SIEM integrations: agents like Datadog or Rapid7 can multiply costs fast. Add to that naive setups like \u0026ldquo;log everything forever\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;query daily with no filters,\u0026rdquo; and you\u0026rsquo;re in trouble.\nKey Principles for Cost-Effective Monitoring Start with native tools: AWS services like EventBridge, CloudTrail, and Config already provide tons of signal. Event-driven \u0026gt; polling: Trigger Lambdas from EventBridge or GuardDuty rather than running scheduled functions. Don\u0026rsquo;t store what you won‚Äôt analyze: Be selective about what you keep beyond 30‚Äì90 days. Use cold storage smartly: S3 + Glacier Deep Archive = cheap long-term retention. Treat logs as tiered assets: hot (analyzed), warm (queryable), cold (archived). Low-Cost Native AWS Tools for Security Monitoring üîç CloudTrail Captures API-level activity. Free for 90 days in Event History. For long-term: use an org-wide trail ‚Üí S3 + lifecycle policy. What to watch for:\nConsoleLogin AssumeRole UnauthorizedOperation Use EventBridge rules or metric filters on these events to alert.\nüìà CloudWatch Logs \u0026amp; Metric Filters Logs cost per GB ingested and retained. Set up metric filters on important events (from CloudTrail logs) to track threats. Example filters:\nRoot login usage Access denied errors Security group changes Pair with CloudWatch Alarms to notify via SNS.\nüéØ EventBridge Serverless event router. Filter and forward events to Lambda, SNS, or other targets. Use for:\nSecurity Hub findings IAM changes GuardDuty alerts Pricing is negligible at moderate volume.\n‚öôÔ∏è AWS Config (targeted) Only enable the rules you care about, like:\nS3 bucket public access IAM root usage CloudTrail enabled Stay under the free tier (100 evaluations/month) or use it sparingly.\nüö® Security Hub + GuardDuty Free for 30 days, then priced by finding volume.

They‚Äôre essential for enabling short-lived, tightly scoped access without the long-term baggage of static IAM user credentials. But with this flexibility comes a new surface for mistakes, misuse, and oversights.\nIn this post, I‚Äôll walk through the core use cases for temporary credentials, how they work, where they go wrong, and the best ways to keep them secure in your environment.\nWhat Are Temporary Credentials, Really? AWS uses temporary credentials via the Security Token Service (STS) to grant access to resources for a limited duration. These credentials are usually assumed via IAM roles, either directly (e.g., sts:AssumeRole) or through identity federation setups (like AWS IAM Identity Center, formerly SSO).\nThey consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a session token ‚Äî all tied to an expiration time. Once expired, they‚Äôre useless.\nCompared to static IAM user keys, this is a huge win: there‚Äôs no need to rotate them manually, and there‚Äôs less risk of long-term exposure. But only if you manage them correctly.\nWhen Should You Use Temporary Credentials? Temporary credentials make the most sense in scenarios like:\nCross-account access: Letting resources or users in one AWS account access another securely Federated users: Providing temporary AWS access to users authenticated through an external IdP (Google, Okta, Azure AD) Machine access: Giving containers, EC2 instances, and Lambda functions the credentials they need to operate ‚Äî without hardcoding anything The key principle is this: temporary credentials are disposable. That makes them ideal for anything short-lived or session-based.\nWhere Things Go Wrong For all their advantages, temporary credentials can cause problems if:\nRoles are overly permissive Session durations are maxed out unnecessarily You‚Äôre not logging and reviewing their use Developers extract them and re-use them outside their intended context These are common missteps. I‚Äôve seen production credentials with full AdministratorAccess scoped to 12-hour sessions being used in CI/CD pipelines with zero monitoring. That defeats the purpose.\nBest Practices for Securing Temporary Credentials Let‚Äôs walk through the most effective ways to keep temp creds from turning into a liability:\nScope Your IAM Roles Carefully Start with least privilege ‚Äî always. Define roles that include only the permissions required for a specific task, service, or automation. Use condition keys like aws:SourceIp, aws:RequestTag, or aws:PrincipalTag to make them even tighter.\nAvoid using wildcard * actions or resources unless you have an ironclad reason.\nSet Conservative Session Durations Just because STS lets you issue credentials for up to 12 hours doesn‚Äôt mean you should. Match the session duration to the activity. For ephemeral workloads (like a GitHub Action), keep it down to 15‚Äì30 minutes.\nShorter sessions reduce the time window for abuse if credentials are leaked.\nLog and Monitor Usage with CloudTrail Every STS call ‚Äî including AssumeRole and GetSessionToken ‚Äî should be logged in CloudTrail. These logs will tell you:\nWho assumed which role When the session started and ended What actions were taken using the temp credentials Consider layering this with CloudWatch or a SIEM (like Wazuh) to alert on suspicious behavior.\nEnforce MFA for Sensitive Role Assumption If a human user is assuming a role with sensitive permissions (e.g. break-glass access), make sure MFA is required to perform role assumption. You can enforce this via IAM policy conditions.\nPro tip: MFA should be enforced always.\nIt adds friction ‚Äî but that‚Äôs the point.\nUse Automation to Rotate and Invalidate Temporary credentials are naturally short-lived, but if you‚Äôre generating them programmatically (via custom scripts or credential vending tools), ensure they‚Äôre:\nRevoked or expired after use (you don\u0026rsquo;t need to do this if you tailor TTL for each role) Not stored in shared volumes or persistent config files Generated with limited scopes AWS SDKs handle a lot of this for you automatically if you\u0026rsquo;re using instance profiles or OIDC-based IAM roles for service accounts.\nAdvanced Topics: IAM Roles Anywhere and Federation If you‚Äôre extending access to on-prem or external systems, consider IAM Roles Anywhere ‚Äî which issues temporary credentials to workloads outside of AWS using signed X.509 certs.\nFor workforce-level federation (like connecting Okta to AWS), make sure the trust policy on your roles includes constraints on who can assume them, and ideally matches on StringEquals or StringLike conditions.\nWrap Up Temporary credentials are meant to improve security ‚Äî not complicate it. But like everything in AWS, it comes down to how they‚Äôre implemented.\nIf you stick to short lifespans, minimal permissions, solid monitoring, and tight boundaries, they‚Äôll serve you well.\nIf not, they‚Äôll become just another attack surface.\n","permalink":"https://thehiddenport.dev/posts/aws-temporary-credentials-security/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTemporary credentials are one of the most powerful ‚Äî and misunderstood ‚Äî access mechanisms in AWS.

For small teams, this means preparing lightweight yet effective incident response workflows that work in the cloud, with the tools you already have.\nIn this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through a modern approach to Incident Response (IR) in AWS, shaped by experience and battle-tested tactics. A downloadable IR playbook is included at the end.\nWhy Cloud IR Is Different In traditional IR, you usually walk into a server room. In AWS, you don‚Äôt have physical access ‚Äî everything is virtual, API-driven, and ephemeral.\nWhat changes:\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t unplug a cable ‚Äî so you isolate via automations, SSM, IAM \u0026hellip; Forensic imaging becomes memory dumps and logs. Evidence handling must be automated and secure while ensuring its chain of custody. Phase 1: Preparation \u0026ldquo;The worst time to build an IR plan is when you\u0026rsquo;re under attack.\u0026rdquo;\nIdeally: Use a Dedicated IR Account If your organization allows, the most secure approach is to:\nCreate a dedicated AWS account within your Organization for incident response. Use it to store forensic snapshots, memory dumps, and analysis artifacts. Restrict access to security engineers only. Alternative: Lock Down a Region If managing another account is out of scope:\nChoose an unused region as your IR region. Create strict SCPs that deny access to that region except for IR roles. Use it to store snapshots, launch analysis EC2 instances. This keeps investigation resources separate and auditable without needing another account. Pre-Provision IR Tools Store AVML (for memory dumps) in a private S3 bucket or include it as a binary in your base AMIs. Create a Lambda to trigger AVML remotely using SSM. Use write-once S3 with versioning for evidence. Provision EC2 instance profiles for analysis tooling. Prepare your own forensics AMI. Destroy used forensics instance to ensure a clean environment. Phase 2: Detection \u0026amp; Triage Enable and monitor:\nSecurity Hub and GuardDuty (region-wide detection) AWS Inspector AWS Config for change auditing EventBridge rules for high-severity findings to trigger automatic notifications Ideally you would have a SIEM ingesting your notifications with a curated set of rules Example triage filter:\naws securityhub get-findings \\ --filters WorkflowStatus=NEW SeverityLabel=CRITICAL Send alerts to SNS topics, email, or Slack integrations for immediate triage.\nPhase 3: Isolation Option 1: SSM Isolation (no reboot needed) aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute \\ --instance-id i-12345678 \\ --no-source-dest-check aws ec2 modify-network-interface-attribute \\ --network-interface-id eni-xyz \\ --groups sg-isolated-only Option 2: Detach From Load Balancers Quick way to prevent public exposure without shutting down the instance.\nPro Tip It is recommended to define your isolation process and automate it.\nPhase 4: Evidence Collection Snapshot Disks aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-0c0e757e277111f3c \\ --description \u0026#39;IR evidence snapshot\u0026#39; --tag-specifications \\ \u0026#39;ResourceType=snapshot,Tags=[{Key=evidence,Value=true},{Key=investigation,Value=InProgress}]\u0026#39; Copy to your IR region or account.\nCapture Memory (Linux) aws ssm send-command \\ --document-name \u0026#34;AWS-RunShellScript\u0026#34; \\ --targets \u0026#34;Key=instanceIds,Values=i-xxxx\u0026#34; \\ --parameters commands=[\u0026#34;sudo ./avml /tmp/memdump.lime\u0026#34;] Send output to your S3 bucket with versioning enabled.\nPro Tip There is no such thing as too many tags, make sure to tag everything, it will help you in the future with your automations or Audits\nPhase 5: Analysis Mount snapshot volumes in EC2 instances in your IR region:\nUse Plaso, Volatility, or log parsing tools Analyze user activity, binaries, system logs Always mount snapshots read-only.\nPhase 6: Remediation \u0026amp; Lessons Learned Rotate IAM keys, delete old roles if it applies Find root cause and generate new AMI/code fix to prevent from happening again Redeploy infrastructure from clean code if it applies Run a blameless retro Store timeline, findings, and action items securely Every user access and actions must be recorded and documented for future audits (Optional) Long-Term Evidence Storage (Cold, Tamper-Proof) Once analysis is complete, evidence must be retained securely ‚Äî sometimes for years ‚Äî depending on your industry, legal requirements, or internal policies.\nWhy It Matters Regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001) often mandate retention. You may need to revisit evidence in future investigations. Chain-of-custody must be intact ‚Äî even if team members change. Best Practice: S3 with Object Lock in Compliance Mode Use an S3 bucket with Object Lock enabled, configured for Compliance mode:\nWORM (Write Once, Read Many): After the retention period is set, no one ‚Äî not even the root user ‚Äî can delete or modify the data. Versioning must be enabled. Compliance mode ensures true immutability. aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket forensic-evidence-storage --object-lock-configuration \u0026#39;{ \u0026#34;ObjectLockEnabled\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Enabled\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Rule\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DefaultRetention\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;COMPLIANCE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Days\u0026#34;: 365 } } }\u0026#39; Pro Tip: Store a signed hash (SHA-256) of the evidence metadata separately in a ticket or case management system for added integrity validation.\nGlacier Deep Archive After the case is closed and data is rarely accessed:\nYou should consider setting a lifecycle policy to transition older snapshots or S3 objects to Glacier Deep Archive. Keep metadata and hashes in S3 Standard for fast audit access. resource \u0026#34;aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration\u0026#34; \u0026#34;archive\u0026#34; { bucket = aws_s3_bucket.forensic.id rule { id = \u0026#34;archive-old-evidence\u0026#34; status = \u0026#34;Enabled\u0026#34; transition { days = 30 storage_class = \u0026#34;DEEP_ARCHIVE\u0026#34; } } } This minimizes cost while still preserving a chain-of-custody‚Äìfriendly trail.\nCheck my own IR Playbook Template üìÑ Online IR Playbook template\nIncludes:\nTriage checklist Memory and disk acquisition workflows Region lockdown guide Incident summary format Final Thoughts You don‚Äôt need a massive budget to handle incidents well in AWS.

Total Study Time All combined ‚Äî including my earlier September sessions ‚Äî I estimate I spent about 80‚Äì100 hours preparing:\nWatching video lectures Taking practice exams Reading explanations of wrong answers Playing around in AWS (hands-on really helped) Exam Focus Areas While the exam touched almost every domain, I noticed a stronger emphasis on:\nAWS Organizations and multi-account management Fleet management (managing large numbers of resources securely) CloudFront security configurations Oddly, no questions about CloudHSM came up for me.\nPractice Exams Tutorial Dojo‚Äôs practice exams were incredibly helpful.\nThey weren‚Äôt exact replicas of the real exam questions ‚Äî but the style, difficulty, and experience were very close to what I faced on exam day.\n‚úÖ I consistently scored 85%+ in both Udemy quizzes and TD practice exams.\n‚úÖ My real exam score was 839, almost perfectly in line with my mocks.\nWhat Helped Me Most The biggest game-changer for me was reading the explanations for every wrong question ‚Äî not just noting the right answer.\nOver time, this helped me deeply understand:\nSubtle differences between similar services (like Macie vs GuardDuty vs Inspector) How AWS expects you to prioritize security controls (least privilege, defense in depth, managed services when possible) My Advice to Future Candidates If I could give just a few tips, it would be:\nFinish at least one good video course completely (Stephane or Zeal are great) Hammer through practice exams ‚Äî and focus more on WHY an answer is correct/incorrect than memorizing Track your weak areas and reinforce them aggressively If possible, get hands-on in an AWS account (even if it‚Äôs free tier) It‚Äôs a technical exam, but it rewards understanding AWS security philosophy, not rote memorization.\nFinal Thoughts The SCS-C02 isn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî but it‚Äôs fair.\nAnd more importantly, it teaches you to think like a Cloud Security Engineer, not just a certification chaser.\nIf you‚Äôre preparing, stick with it.\nYou‚Äôll come out not just with a certification, but with real skills you can immediately apply.\nGood luck ‚Äî and see you at The Hidden Port for more cloud security deep dives!\nüì© Stay Tuned I\u0026rsquo;m planning more AWS security, incident response, and hands-on content soon.\nIf you found this helpful, feel free to check out thehiddenport.dev.\n","permalink":"https://thehiddenport.dev/posts/aws-scs-c02-exam-experience/","summary":"My real-world journey passing the AWS Certified Security ‚Äì Specialty (SCS-C02) exam.

Whether it‚Äôs a developer giving s3:* to an app or a CI/CD pipeline allowed to iam:*, misconfigurations create unnecessary attack surface.\nIAM Access Analyzer helps fix that ‚Äî by showing you what access your policies really grant, and by helping you build tighter permissions from real-world usage data.\nWhat Is IAM Access Analyzer? IAM Access Analyzer is a native AWS feature that helps you:\nIdentify who has access to your AWS resources (trust policies) Analyze what your IAM policies allow (policy analyzer) Generate fine-grained IAM policies based on actual usage It\u0026rsquo;s split into two capabilities:\nFeature Purpose Policy validation \u0026amp; simulation Checks whether your policies are overly broad Access Analyzer (policy generation) Watches IAM role activity and suggests tight-scoped policy JSON Available via console, CLI, SDK, and supported by Terraform\nEnabling IAM Access Analyzer You must have AWS Organizations enabled or a standalone account with IAM Analyzer permissions.\nCLI: aws accessanalyzer create-analyzer --analyzer-name \u0026#34;org-analyzer\u0026#34; --type ORGANIZATION Use --type ACCOUNT if you\u0026rsquo;re not using AWS Organizations.\nTerraform: resource \u0026#34;aws_accessanalyzer_analyzer\u0026#34; \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;org-analyzer\u0026#34; type = \u0026#34;ORGANIZATION\u0026#34; } Once enabled, it starts monitoring for:\nExternal access grants (e.g., cross-account S3 bucket access, CICD access\u0026hellip;) Overly broad IAM policies Analyzing a Role for Over-Permission Let‚Äôs simulate a policy and see if it‚Äôs too permissive.\nStep 1: Write the IAM policy { \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } } Step 2: Run a simulation aws iam simulate-custom-policy --policy-input-list file://policy.json --action-names \u0026#34;s3:ListBucket\u0026#34; \u0026#34;ec2:StartInstances\u0026#34; \u0026#34;iam:DeleteUser\u0026#34; You‚Äôll get a result for each action: allowed or explicitDeny.\nGenerating Policies from CloudTrail Activity IAM Access Analyzer can automatically generate least-privilege IAM policies by analyzing your CloudTrail logs. This lets you replace over-permissive policies with ones that reflect actual usage.\nThis requires CloudTrail to be enabled in the account and set to log to an S3 bucket.\nStep-by-Step in AWS Console Go to the IAM Console:\nNavigate to IAM and click on the desired role. Go to ‚ÄúGenerate policy based on CloudTrail events‚Äù:\nHere you‚Äôll see the \u0026ldquo;Generate Policy\u0026rdquo; button, click it. Fill the form:\nFill the form to meet your criteria. You can choose a time range from the available CloudTrail logs. Choose the CloudTrail trail that has the relevant data. Click on Generate Policy:\nAWS will scan CloudTrail logs and determine which actions were used. Review and download the policy once ready:\nOnce the job completes, you‚Äôll see a generated policy document. You can copy the JSON, edit it if needed, and attach it to the principal directly or via Terraform. üß† This process can take a few minutes depending on the volume of logs. The policy reflects only observed usage ‚Äî consider reviewing manually before attaching.\nPro Tips Always start Access Analyzer before running new workloads (so it can monitor them) Run it again after a few days of usage to refine permissions Use managed policies for standard access, but custom policies for sensitive services like S3, IAM, EC2 Extra Hardening Use these IAM policy techniques to limit blast radius:\nRequire MFA for IAM console sessions { \u0026#34;Condition\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;BoolIfExists\u0026#34;: {\u0026#34;aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34;} } } Use Permission Boundaries Permission boundaries are a powerful but often misunderstood feature of IAM.\nA permission boundary is an advanced policy that defines the maximum permissions a role or user can be granted ‚Äî even if their assigned IAM policy is broader. It acts as a safety net or ‚Äúguardrail‚Äù to prevent privilege escalation or accidental over-permissioning.\nFor example, if a developer tries to attach an AdministratorAccess policy to a role, but a permission boundary restricts actions to s3:* and ec2:Describe*, then only those actions will be allowed ‚Äî everything else is denied.\nThis is especially useful in environments where:\nDevelopers or CI/CD pipelines create their own roles or policies You\u0026rsquo;re delegating IAM permissions within a sandbox or dev account You want to limit access in automation scenarios without managing every detail To use them effectively:\nDefine a boundary policy that allows a scoped set of actions Attach the boundary to IAM roles during creation Enforce via Infrastructure as Code (like Terraform) to avoid manual missteps Final Thoughts IAM Access Analyzer helps bridge the gap between \u0026ldquo;theory of least privilege\u0026rdquo; and actual policy enforcement. It\u0026rsquo;s not perfect ‚Äî but when combined with Terraform and CloudTrail, it\u0026rsquo;s one of the best tools to clean up risky roles without slowing down dev teams.\nUse it to:\nSimulate policies before deployment Detect risky cross-account access Generate scoped policies from real CloudTrail usage For a comprehensive overview of securing your AWS environment, refer to our broader AWS security checklist.\nIn a world of too much access, precision wins. IAM Access Analyzer gives you the tools ‚Äî now go sharpen your policies. üîê\n","permalink":"https://thehiddenport.dev/posts/iam-access-analyzer-least-privilege/","summary":"Use IAM Access Analyzer to build least-privilege IAM roles in AWS ‚Äî includes policy generation from CloudTrail, Terraform integration, and AWS best practices.","title":"Building Least-Privilege IAM Roles with IAM Access Analyzer"},{"content":"Why Root Account Usage Should Raise an Alarm In a secure AWS setup, the root user should almost never be used.
